foo = 0
p foo # shows 0 - refering to the code above it
p "foo" # actualy shows qoutes e.g. "foo"

print foo # shows 0 - refering to foo = 0
print "foo" # DOES NOT SHOW QOUTES --- this is why p is used for debugging i.e. it uses inspect()

puts foo # shows 0 - refering to foo = 0 -- stuck next to output from print "foo" as print does not "print" does not print newline
puts "foo" # DOES NOT SHOW QOUTES --- this is why p is used for debugging i.e. it uses inspect()
