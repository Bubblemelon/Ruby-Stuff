# Ruby Practice

This is where I store some of my practice scrips written in ruby.


## Catalog

### [oddnumsum.rb](https://github.com/Bubblemelon/Ruby-Stuff/blob/master/ruby%20practice/oddnumsum.rb) `oddnumsum(array)`  
> Takes an array of integers.  
> Returns the sum of only odd integers from that array.  

### [vowelremoval.rb](https://github.com/Bubblemelon/Ruby-Stuff/blob/master/ruby%20practice/vowelremoval.rb) `vowelremoval(string)`  
> Takes a string of lowercase letters.  
> Coverts it to an array
> Returns a string with all vowels removed.

### [z-near-a.rb](https://github.com/Bubblemelon/Ruby-Stuff/blob/master/ruby%20practice/z-near-a.rb)

  - `z_after_a(string)`  
  
    > Takes a string of lowercase letters.  
    > Returns true if the letter "z" appears within three indexes after an "a".
    > e.g. 0 => a, then z must appear with indexes [1], [2], [3] .
